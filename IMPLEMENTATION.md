# FieldClimate Weather Station Project Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the FieldClimate Weather Station Data Collection and Visualization project.

## Implementation Summary

The project was implemented following the specification and consists of two main components:

1. **Data Collection Service**: A Python-based service that interacts with the FieldClimate API to retrieve weather data from stations and store it in a SQLite database.

2. **Visualization Component**: Interactive dashboards built with Quarto that provide visual representations of the collected data.

## Key Components

### 1. API Integration

The `api_client.py` module implements a robust client for the FieldClimate API with:

- HMAC authentication as specified
- Rate limiting controls to respect the API's limits
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Error handling for various API-related issues

### 2. Data Model

The database schema is implemented in `models.py` with tables for:

- `stations`: Weather station metadata
- `sensors`: Sensor metadata linked to stations
- `measurements`: Time-series data from sensors

The schema includes appropriate indexes for query performance optimization.

### 3. Collection Process

The data collection process is orchestrated by `data_collector.py`, which:

- Initializes stations from configuration
- Discovers sensors for new stations
- Retrieves data incrementally since the last update
- Processes and stores data in the database
- Provides detailed collection statistics

### 4. Dashboard Visualization

The visualization component consists of two main dashboards:

- `overview.qmd`: Shows all stations, their status, and current conditions
- `station.qmd`: Detailed view of a single station with interactive charts for each sensor

The dashboards are built with Quarto and use Plotly for interactive visualizations. They connect directly to the SQLite database.

## Authentication Implementation

The HMAC authentication is implemented as specified, with:

- Separate text files for public and private keys
- Secure signature generation for each API request
- Proper timestamp handling for request signing

## Error Handling

The error handling strategy includes:

- Categorized error types for different scenarios
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent excessive retries
- Comprehensive logging of all errors

## Rate Limiting

The rate limiting implementation respects the platform limits:

- Self-throttling to stay under API limits
- Request tracking per station
- Adaptive delays between requests when approaching limits

## Command-Line Interface

The CLI is implemented with support for:

- Data collection for all stations or specific stations
- Time range specification for historical data backfilling
- Database statistics reporting
- Verbose output options

## Style and Branding

The dashboard styling is consistent with the specified requirements:

- Use of Lato for normal text
- Use of Intel One Mono for monospaced text and code
- Consistent color scheme defined in `_brand.yml`
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
